# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Project

## Overview

This project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and evaluating SVM models using Python and relevant machine learning libraries.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementation of SVM for classification tasks.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Visualization of decision boundaries (if applicable).
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install via the command below):
  
# Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BineeshaBaby/SVM-Tutorial.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SVM-Tutorial

# Open the notebook
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb


# Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name
#Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the SVM model.

# Dataset
Specify the dataset used in this project:

-Dataset name: Iris DataSet
-Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
-Description:The Iris Dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, widely used for testing classification algorithms. It is simple, small in size, and perfect for beginners in data science.

## Results

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was trained and evaluated on the Iris dataset. Below are the key results:

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 97%
- **Precision**: 96% (average across all classes)
- **Recall**: 97% (average across all classes)
- **F1-Score**: 96% (average across all classes)

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows the model's classification performance:

| Actual / Predicted | Setosa | Versicolor | Virginica |
|---------------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Setosa**          | 50     | 0          | 0         |
| **Versicolor**      | 0      | 47         | 3         |
| **Virginica**       | 0      | 2          | 48        |

### Decision Boundary Visualization
The decision boundaries for SVM are visualized for different feature pairs, showing clear separation between classes:

### Key Insights
- The SVM model, using the RBF kernel, performed exceptionally well in separating the three Iris species.
- Most misclassifications occurred between `Versicolor` and `Virginica`, due to overlapping feature distributions.
