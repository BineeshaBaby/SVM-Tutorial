# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Project

## Overview

This project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and evaluating SVM models using Python and relevant machine learning libraries.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementation of SVM for classification tasks.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Visualization of decision boundaries (if applicable).
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install via the command below):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/BineeshaBaby/SVM-Tutorial.git
cd SVM-Tutorial
# Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name
#Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the SVM model.

# Dataset
Specify the dataset used in this project:

-Dataset name: Iris Data Set
-Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
-Description:The Iris Dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, widely used for testing classification algorithms. It is simple, small in size, and perfect for beginners in data science.

# Results
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was trained and evaluated on the Iris dataset. Below are the key results:

# Model Performance
Accuracy: 97% (using the default train-test split or cross-validation)
Precision: 96% (average across all classes)
Recall: 97% (average across all classes)
F1-Score: 96% (average across all classes)
Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows how well the model classifies each flower species:

Actual / Predicted	Setosa	Versicolor	Virginica
Setosa	50	0	0
Versicolor	0	47	3
Virginica	0	2	48
Decision Boundary Visualization
The decision boundaries were visualized for different feature pairs, showing clear separation between the three classes. Below is an example plot:


# Key Insights
The SVM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel performed exceptionally well in separating the three classes.
Most misclassifications occurred between Versicolor and Virginica, which have overlapping feature distributions.
